# CNS-186-Project
## Active Learning for Image Classification
For this project, we are going to train a custom neural network architecture to
classify images from the MNIST numbers dataset.

With this, we are going to train using both active and standard supervised
learning techniques to compare how these differ for image classification.

Specifically, the pool based active learning methods that we are electing to
compare are largest margin, smallest margin, entropy, and least confidence.
